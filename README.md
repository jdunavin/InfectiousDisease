These Jupyter notebooks are for me to learn about SEIR models and how they work. My interests in such models are both professional and personal. One notebook is for the lessons I used to teach myself about the models and how to implement them in Python, and then I will try to fit a model to data from my home state of Kansas. Others have done this better than I will - namely [You Yang Gu](https://covid19-projections.com/) and [IHME](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america), among others.
